Most roles win if all players from opposing teams are eliminated\nThe teams are Town, Mafia, Cult, Fiends\n- Town should try to find out who the mafia is in order to vote them out\n- Mafia, cult, and fiends, should try to stay hidden while killing townies\n\nThe game runs in phases of day and night\n- During night, each player uses their roles abilities\n- During the day, players discuss information they learned and vote on a player to kill\n\nThere are subphases within day and night\n\n# Night\nMost role abilities work at night. Here are some examples\n- Each night, the godfather can select a player to kill them\n- Each night, the detective can select a player. The detective is told if the player they select is innocent or suspicious. This would help the detective find out who the mafia is. If they are suspicious they are not a townie\n- Each night, the framer can select a player to make them register falsely to the detective. So a townie could register as suspicious to a detective falsely if a framer used their ability\n\n# Obituary\nDuring the obituary phase, everyone is told who died, along with the role and alibi of those who died.\nAll players should keep their alibi note page to keep track of all the information they learned during the game. The obituary phase is a perfect time to write down in your alibi what you learned last night. For example:\n\n- If you're a detective who learned that @5 is suspicious on night 1. You could write your alibi to look like this\n\nDetective\nNight 1: @5 - suspicious\n\nIt is also important for non townie players to keep a fake alibi to pretend that they are a townie\n\n# Discussion\nThe discussion phase is where players discuss the information they learned and try to find out who the mafia, fiends, and cult are\nPlayers will ask each other to claim, this means they want to know the information that the other player learned\nMost players send their alibi in chat during this phase, to share the information efficiently in response to being asked to claim. It will likely be considered suspicious to not have an alibi prepared when asked for one. So its very important to have one prepared, no matter who you are\n\n# Nomination\nDuring nomination, players can vote other players on to trial in order to execute them\nThe best way for townies to kill mafia members is to use their vote, even if you aren‚Äôt certain someone is evil, voting them onto trial and threatening them will often give information to help find mafia\n- If more than half of the living players vote for one player, that player is put on trial\n- If there aren‚Äôt enough votes in time, the game skips directly to dusk\n\n# Testimony\n- The player voted on trail is the only player allowed to speak and chat during this phase, they should certainly claim, send their alibi and say what their role is\n\n# Judgement\n- Everyone votes innocent or guilty (or abstains)\n- If more players vote guilty than innocent, the player on trial will be executed\n- If the player on trial isn‚Äôt executed, there is another trail (with a max of three)\n\n# Final words\n- The player who was on trial should be allowed to say some final words or notes they have for the town\n\n# Dusk\n- A prenight phase for everyone to get a last word in before the next night\n\n# Final thoughts\nThe game runs in this loop until there is one team remaining\nThe encyclopedia has a list of all roles and their abilities. It is recommended to read up on your role during the beginning briefing phase\nIf your evil, you should try to learn how at least one townie role works so you can pretend to be that role\nNeutral roles all have different win conditions and are not on a team. For example: Jester wins if they are voted out during a trail",
